<h1>How to Add Lottie Animations to a Website with HTML</h1>

    <p>
        Have a web page you’d like to spruce up? It’s easy to add engaging animations to your site with Lottie. Lottie animations are super small file formats, so you can add pizzazz without slowing down your site. Plus, they can be scaled up or down without losing quality.

    <p> So where do you get Lottie animations? Perhaps you’ve got an animator who has already created a bespoke animation for you, and exported it from Adobe After Effects using the LottieFiles plugin. If you don’t, you can browse thousands of free animations on LottieFiles. Customize them with the Lottie Editor or Color Palette feature to suit your brand or design, then use them in your personal and commercial projects!
